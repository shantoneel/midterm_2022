Please answer the below Data Structure Questions:

why do we need data structure?
Data Structures are necessary for designing efficient algorithms. It provides reusability and abstraction.


What are the various operations that can be performed on different Data Structures?
There are eight operations that are performed on different data structures.
IsEmpty.
AddBefore.
AddAfter.
push.
pop.
ExtractMax.
sort.

List out the areas in which data structures are applied extensively?
Data structures are used in any program or software.
They are used in the areas of.
Compiler Design.
Operating System.
DBMS.
Graphics.
Simulation.
Numerical Analysis.

what is an Array?
An array is a collection of similar data elements stored at contiguous memory locations.
It is the simplest data structure where each
data element can be accessed directly by only using its index number.

what is the difference between the Array and ArrayList?
An array has both primitive data types as well as object data types.
However, ArrayList has only object-type data entries and not primitive data types.

what is LinkedList?
linked list consists of nodes where each node contains
a data field and a reference(link) to the next node in the list.

How is an Array different from Linked List?
An array is a collection of elements of a similar data type. Linked List is an ordered
collection of elements of the same type in which each element is connected to the next using pointers.

what is queue?
Java Queue represents an ordered list of elements. Java Queue follows FIFO order to insert and remove it's elements.
FIFO stands for First In First Out. Java Queue supports all methods of Collection interface.

what is stack?
Stack is a class that falls under the Collection framework that extends the Vector class.

what is FIFO and LIFO?
Fifo = first in first out. Lifo = Last in first out.

what is the order of complexity?
what is the best case to search an element from an array?
The best-case performance for the Linear Search algorithm is when the search item appears at the beginning of the list and is O(1).


what is the worst case to search an element from an array?
The worst-case performance is when the search item appears at the end of the list or not at all.
This would require N comparisons, hence, the worse case is O(N).

what is tree in data structure?
A tree is a widely used abstract data type that represents a hierarchical
tree structure with a set of connected nodes.

what is graph in data structure?
A Graph is a non-linear data structure consisting of vertices and edges.
The vertices are sometimes also referred to as nodes and the edges are lines or arcs that connect
any two nodes in the graph. More formally a Graph is composed of a set of vertices( V )
and a set of edges( E ). The graph is denoted by G(E, V).

what is the difference between the HashTable and HashMap?
One of the major differences between HashMap and Hashtable is that HashMap is non-synchronized whereas
Hashtable is synchronized, which means Hashtable is thread-safe and can be shared between multiple threads but
HashMap can not be shared between multiple threads without proper synchronization.

What are the major data structures used in the following areas : RDBMS, Network data model and Hierarchical data model.
RDBMS = Array (i.e. Array of structures) Network data model = Graph. Hierarchical data model = Trees

How HashMap works in java?
HashMap stores entries into multiple singly linked lists, called buckets or bins.
Default number of bins is 16 and it's always power of 2. HashMap uses hashCode() and equals() methods on
keys for get and put operations.
So HashMap key object should provide good implementation of these methods.

What is ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException in java? When it occurs?
The ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException is a runtime exception in Java that occurs when an array is accessed with an illegal index.
The index is either negative or greater than or equal to the size of the array.

What are the different ways of copying an array into another array?
Iterating each element of the given original array and copy one element at a time.
Using clone() method.
Using arraycopy() method.
Using copyOf() method of Arrays class.
Using copyOfRange() method of Arrays clas

What is difference between an array and a linked list?
An array is a collection of elements of a similar data type. Linked List is an ordered collection of elements of the same type in which each element is connected to the next using pointers.
Array elements can be accessed randomly using the array index

What is DFS and BFS?
BFS(Breadth First Search) uses Queue data structure for finding the shortest path.
DFS(Depth First Search) uses Stack data structure.

What is Recursion?A recursive function solves a particular problem by calling a
copy of itself and solving smaller subproblems of the original problems.

What are linear and non linear data Structures?
A Linear data structure have data elements arranged in sequential manner and each member
element is connected to its previous and next element.A non-linear data structure has no set sequence of connecting all its elements and each element can have multiple paths to connect to other elements. Such data structures supports multi-level storage and often cannot be traversed in single run. Such data structures are not easy
to implement but are more efficient in utilizing computer memory.

What is Big-(O)-notation?
“Big O notation is a mathematical notation that describes the limiting behavior of a function when the argument tends
towards a particular value or infinity.

Outlined different kind of sorting algorithm with time complexity?
Algorithm	Time Complexity	Space Complexity
Best	Worst
Quick Sort	Ω(n log(n))	O(n)
Merge Sort	Ω(n log(n))	O(n)
Bucket Sort	Ω(n +k)	O(n)

Draw a table with time complexity in which it will summarize all the data structure feature's advantages and disadvantages.
  a)In terms of Accessing element.
  b)In terms of Inserting element.
  c)In terms of Searching element.
  d)In terms of Removing element.

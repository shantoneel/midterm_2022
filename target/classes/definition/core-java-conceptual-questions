Explain the entire java life cycle.
Life cycle of Java tells us what happens right from the point when we type source
code in a text editor to the point that source code is converted into machine code.
There are three main states in the life cycle of a java program which is 1. Editing
the program, 2. Compiling the source code, 3. Executing the byte code. Firstly, the
program is typed in a text-editor. After completing editing of the program, the file
has to be saved. Second step is compilation, in which the name of the compiler is
Javac. The input to the compiler is Java source code which is available in
Sample.java. The output of the compiler is machine independent or platform
independent code which is known as bytecode. Last step is execution. The
bytecode generated by the compiler will be executed by JVM. Input to the JVM is
bytecode and output is machine code which will be executed by the CPU of the
local machine.

what is class?
A class — in the context of Java — is a template used to create objects and to define object data types and methods.
Classes are categories, and objects are items within each category.

What is object?
A Java object is a member (also called an instance) of a Java class. Each object has an identity, a behavior and a state.
The state of an object is stored in fields (variables), while methods (functions) display the object's behavior.

What is the entry point of an application?
Entry point of an application is the point from where the program starts its
execution.
Why main is static?
Main is static so that the compiler can call it without the creation of an object or
before the creation of an object of the class.

Which class is the superclass of all classes?
The object class is the super class of all classes. All predefined classes and user-
defined classes are the subclass from the Object class.

What is difference between path and classpath variables?
The main difference between Path and Classpath is that Path is set for java tools in
java programs. Whereas classpath is used by system or application class loaders to
locate and load compiled java bytecodes stored in the .class file.

What is the difference between an Interface and Abstract class?
The main difference between an interface and an abstract class is that an interface
cannot have state, in comparison to the abstract class that can have state with
instance variables.

Can you make an Object from an Interface and Abstract class ? if not how do you use it ?
We cannot create objects of an abstract class. To implement features of an abstract class, we inherit subclasses from it and create objects of the subclass. A subclass must override all abstract methods of an abstract class.
However, if the subclass is declared abstract, it's not mandatory to override abstract methods.

what is Access Specifier?
Access specifiers define the visibility of the class. It is a defining code element that
can determine which elements of a program are allowed to access a specific
variable or other piece of data.

What is OOP ? Define each feature of java OOP.
OOP stands for Object-Oriented Programming.
Abstraction: In Java, abstraction means simple things like objects, classes
and variables represent more complex underlying code and data. This is
important because it lets you avoid repeating the same work multiple times.
Encapsulation: Protective barrier that keeps the data and code safe within
the class itself and then reuse objects like code components or variables
without allowing open access to the data system-wide.
Polymorphism: Allows programmers to use the same word in Java to
mean different things in different contexts.
Inheritance: A special feature of Object-Oriented Programming in Java
which lets programmers to create new classes that share some of the
attributes of existing classes.

What is Java Package and which package is imported by default?
Java package is a group of similar types of classes, interfaces and sub-packages.
Package in Java can be categorized in two forms, built-in package and user defined
package. By default, the java.lang package is imported in a Java Program.

What is API? Name list of API that you have used so far.
API stands for application programming interface, a concept that applies
everywhere from command-line tools to enterprise code, microservices, and cloud-
native architectures. Using apps like Facebook, sending messages, or even
checking the weather are examples of using an API.

Does java support multiple inheritance, explain why or why not?
Java does not support multiple inheritance in classes because it can lead to
diamond problems and rather than providing some complex way to solve it, there
are better ways through the same results as multiple inheritance can be achieved.

What is method overloading and when it happens?
Method overloading is two or more methods that can have the same name inside
the same class if they accept different arguments. It can be achieved by either

changing the number of arguments or changing the data type of arguments.

Explain exceptions in java and how to handle it.
An exception object is an instance of an exception class. It gets created and handed
to the Java runtime when an exceptional event occurs that disrupts the normal flow
of the application.

Explain exceptions in java and how to handle it.
An exception is an event, which occurs during the execution of a program, that disrupts the normal flow of the program's instructions.
Exceptions can be handled by throws keyword or using try and catch block.

What is static keyword in java? How it has been used in variables and methods ?
In Java, the static keyword is mainly used for memory management. It can be used
with variables, methods, blocks and nested classes. Static is used for a constant
variable or a method that is the same for every instance of a class.

What is final and how it has been used variables and methods?
In Java, the final keyword is a non-access modifier used for classes, attributes and
methods, which makes them non-changeable. The final keyword can be used while
declaring an entity.

What is final, finally and finalize?
Final is a keyboard and is used as an access modifier in Java. Finally is a block in
Java used for Exception Handling. Finalize is a method in Java used for Garbage
Collection. Application. Lastly, Final in Java is used with variables, methods, and
classes to set access permissions.

What is a constructor ?
A constructor in Java is a special method that is used to initialize objects. The
constructor is called when an object of a class is created.

Can we have multiple constructors in a class?
There can be multiple constructors in a class. However, the parameter list of the
constructors should not be the same.

If we don't have a constructor declared, what is called during the object creation?
The default constructor is called during object creation.

What is "this" keyword in java ?
The “this” keyword refers to the current object in a method or constructor.

What is "super" keyword in java? How many possible way can you use?
The “super” keyboard refers to superclass (parent) objects. It is used to call
superclass methods, and to access the superclass constructor.

What is JVM stand for ?
Java virtual machine.
Is JVM platform independent?
The JVM platform is independent. It supports portability as one of its key features
since its code’s portable bytecode makes it platform-independent.
What version of java are you using?
1.8.
What is JAR stand for ?
JAR stands for Java Archive.
What is the difference between JDK and JVM?
JVM is the abbreviation for Java virtual machine. The JDK is a software
development kit that develops applications in Java.

What is the difference between JVM and JRE?
JRE is the implementation of JVM. It provides a platform to execute Java
programs. It provides a platform to execute Java programs. JRE consists of JVM.

What is compile time and run time?
Compile time is the period when the programming code is converted to the
machine code. Runtime is the period of time when a program is running and
generally occurs after compile time.

What is heap?
The Java Heap is the area of memory used to store objects instantiated by
applications running on the JVM.

How java manage it's memory?
Memory management in Java refers to allocating and deallocating memory to Java
objects which reside in areas called Stack and Heap.

What is the difference between String, StringBuffer and StringBuilder?
String: String class represents character strings. String is immutable in Java so it is
suitable in a multi-threaded environment. 
StringBuffer: StringBuffer is synchronized (thread safe). It means two threads
can’t call the methods of StringBuffer simultaneously. StringBuffer is less efficient
than StringBuilder.
StringBuilder: StringBuilder is non-synchronized (not thread safe). It means two
threads can call the methods of StringBuilder simultaneously.

What is Singleton class?
Singleton class is a class that can have only one object at a time.
What is Serialization and Deserialization?
Serialization is a mechanism of converting the state of an object into a byte
stream.
Deserialization is the reverse process where the byte stream is used to recreate the
actual java object in memory

when to use transient variable in java?
Transient variables are used when we don&#39;t have to save values of a particular
variable in a file at the time of serialization.

Difference between while and do..while loop?
In the while loop, the condition is checked prior to executing any statements
whereas in the case of do while loop, statements are run at least once and then the
condition is verified.

What is Enum?
An Enum type is a special data type that enables for a variable to be a set of
predefined constants.
What is Iterator?
An iterator is an object that can be used to loop through collections, like Arraylist
and HashSet.
Which one will take more memory, an int or Integer?
Int is a primitive data type and takes 32 bits (4 bytes) to store. Integer is an object
which takes 128 bits (16 bytes) to store its int value.

Why is String Immutable in Java?
The String is immutable in Java because of the security, synchronization and
concurrency, caching, and class loading.

What is constructor chaining in Java?
Constructor chaining in Java is the ability to call a constructor inside another
constructor.
The difference between Serial and Parallel Garbage Collector?
The difference between Serial and Parallel Garbage Collector is that the parallel
collector has multiple threads that are used to speed up garbage collection. Serial
garbage collector uses the only thread for garbage collection.

What is JIT stands for?
Just-In-Time compiler is a component of the runtime environment that improves
the performance of Java.

Explain Java Heap space and Garbage collection?
The heap is created when the JVM starts up and may increase or decrease in size
while the application runs. When Heap becomes full, garbage is collected. And
then during garbage collection, objects that are no longer used are cleared, thus
making space for new objects.

Can you guarantee the garbage collection process?
What is the difference between stack and heap in Java?
Java Heap Space is used throughout the application, but Stack is only used for the
method or methods currently running.

What is reflection in java and why is it useful?
Reflection is a Java feature that allows an executing Java program to examine or
“introspect” upon itself, and manipulate internal properties of the program.

what is multithreading in java?
Multithreading refers to a process of executing two or more threads simultaneously
for maximum utilization of the CPU.

What is the use of synchronization in Java?
Synchronization in java is the capability to control the access of multiple threads to
any shared resource.

What is Framework?
Frameworks are bodies of reusable pre-written code acting as templates that
developers can use to create applications by filling in custom code as needed.

What are the testing Framework available in java?
JUnit
TestNG
SerenityBDD
Mockito
Difference between jUnit and testNG?
JUnit is a framework that is open source and may be used to write and trigger tests.
TestNG is a Java-based framework that provides an improved way to run tests.

What are the dependencies for this project?
what is dependency injection in java?
Dependency injection in Java is a way to achieve inversion of control in the
application by moving objects binding compile time to runtime.
What is static binding and dynamic binding?
Static binding uses Type information for binding while dynamic binding uses
objects to resolve binding.
